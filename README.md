The goal is to create a restaurant website.

To see the final result [click here](https://guillaume-leo.github.io/restaurant-css-framework/)

######  Instructions:

The website must be **responsive**, at least for small and medium screens. It must at least have five accessible pages: welcome, menu, pictures, restaurants and contact.

* Welcome

  A page with one *Jumbotron* and two panels to show news (promo, events, etc…).

* Menu

  A page with the restaurant menu in the form of a grouped list with badges.

* Pictures

  A page with a gallery of minimum 10 pictures and a pagination (3 photos per page).

* Restaurant

  A page about the restaurants (it’s a franchise) with its addresses, a map, and different schedules.

* Contact

  A page with a contact form containing the firstname, lastname, email, subject of the message (a drop-down list with multiple options), an area for the message itself and a send button with an icon. Each entry as a title in a semantically correct tag.

  ###### My Adventure:

  

  First I tried to create a "draft" using [figma](www.figma.com) to have an idea of where I was going to.

  I think I didn't spent enough time on this part, because at the end the result is too much different.

  Here is the result of what I did :
